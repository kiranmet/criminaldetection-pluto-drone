# Security Surveillance Drone System

## Overview
This project implements an advanced drone simulation system using the Pluto framework, specifically designed for security surveillance and crime prevention. The system demonstrates autonomous patrolling, suspicious activity detection, and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Alignment
This project contributes to the following SDGs:
- SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities (Safe and secure urban environments)
- SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (Effective law enforcement)
- SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (Smart security systems)

## Features
- Autonomous patrol routes
- Real-time video surveillance
- Suspicious activity detection
- Emergency response coordination
- Privacy-preserving monitoring
- Night vision capabilities
- Thermal imaging simulation
- Automated alert system
